% DynaPS_mb.m  This model includes the mass balance equations for the full model of photosynthesis.

function DynaPS_DYDT = DynaPS_mb(t, DynaPS_Con, BF_Param, FI_Param, PS_PR_Param, RuACT_Param, RedoxReg_Param, XanCycle_Param, SUCS_Param)

% Try out one new way of calculating the mass balance equation.
% In this new way, all the previous calcuations of mass balance equation is preserved and only the necessary changes are made.

%% Step One: Get the initialization of the concentrations for the RedoxReg model which will be used in the calculation of mb of RedoxReg.

for m = 1:92
    RA_Con(m) = DynaPS_Con (m);
end


for m = 1:4
    XanCycle_Con(m) = DynaPS_Con(m + 92);
end

% This is a sensitivity test to show that the model is stable udner fluctuating light

light = Condition (t);

FI_Param(1) = light;
BF_Param(1) = light;

RA_DYDT = RA_mb(t, RA_Con, BF_Param, FI_Param, PS_PR_Param, RuACT_Param, SUCS_Param);
XanCycle_DYDT = XanCycle_mb(t, XanCycle_Con, XanCycle_Param);

% Here get the rate of Thioredoxin reduction and oxidation and use it to construct the differential equation for both thio and fd.
