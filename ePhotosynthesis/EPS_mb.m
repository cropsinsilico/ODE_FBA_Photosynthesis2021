% Try out one new way of calculating the mass balance equation.
% In this new way, all the previous calcuations of mass balance equation is preserved and only the necessary changes are made.

%% Step One: Get the initialization of the concentrations for the PSPR model which will be used in the calculation of mb of CM.

for m = 1:52
    FIBF_Con(m) = EPS_Con(m);
end

for m = 1:36
    CMs(m) = EPS_Con(m+52);
end

% This is a sensitivity test to show that the model is stable udner fluctuating light
% the condition are is distributed into the separate mb file. 

% Step II, Calculate the PYPT using the existing modules.
CM_DYDT = CM_mb(t,CMs,PS_PR_Param, Sucs_Param);
FIBF_DYDT = FIBF_MB(t, FIBF_Con, BF_Param, FI_Param);

% Step III: Calculate the mass balanec equation for the EPS model. This basically need to make sure that the variables 
% used in the mass balance equation should be in exact sequence with the sequence used in the inialization.

EPS_DYDT = zeros(88,1);
for m = 1:52
    EPS_DYDT(m) = FIBF_DYDT(m);
end

for m = 1:36
